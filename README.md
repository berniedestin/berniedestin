### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Destin a new software developer, and recent graduate of Tech Elevator Coding Bootcamp!

ðŸ‘‰ Here's a little [Etch-a-sketch project](https://berniedestin.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/) I did a while ago.

ðŸ‘‰ Here's [a terminal project I'm working on right now.](https://berniedestin.github.io/terminal-page/) I wanted to emulate the feel of a terminal, but on the front end.
  - Try typing ```add 1 2``` or insert your own numbers ```add <number> <number> <number> ...```
  - After a few commands, try typing ```clear```
